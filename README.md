# Brewdog Untappd Rating Scraper

A web scraping script that collects the current tap list at Brewdog bars and gathers the untappd rating and description and renders into a HTML template.

I enjoy the BrewDog drinks and the guest beers they get in. But I was sick of not being able to read the small beer menu's and confusing sign behind the bars, that I made sure that I was armed with information about what to drink before arriving.
